# Sequencing

The sequencing for this project was performed by Admera Health facilitated by GenoHub. See details of samples [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TMw7K-arOcS5Hno32ayN-WMWPbxs6pXObnOoFU_iAeA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## Collection
Samples were collected in 2023 and 2024. 20 colonies of aphids with attending ants were collected into vials of 96% Ethanol and RNALater. Similarly, attending ants were also collected into vials of ethanol and RNAlater. 

## Extraction
Since aphids have both DNA and RNA viruses, we sequenced both DNA and RNA of ants and aphids. 
For DNA, samples were extracted using QIAmp DNA Micro Kit. KAPA Hyper Prep was used for library prep for whole genome sequencing on an illumina machine aiming for at least 100M 150bp paired end reads (50M per sample). 
For RNA, samples were extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. For the first four samples, the Qiaseq Fast Select Fly Kit with NEB Next Ultra (II) Directional was used for ribosomal depletion. However, because >80% of reads were still ribosomal, the following 16 samples used Ribozero Plus + NEBNext Ultra II Directional. Samples were similarly sequenced with Illumina aiming for 100M paired end reads per sample.
