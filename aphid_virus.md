# Do ants and aphids share viruses?

Aphids are important disease transmitters for plant diseases. Sometimes, ants are important defenders of aphids. Is it possible that ants could be transmitting plant diseases from aphid to aphid?
## Questions
* Do aphids and ants collected in a single collecting event share viruses?
* Do all aphids or all ants share viruses?
* Are any of the viruses we recover related to plants?
* Are there more plant viruses in ants or aphids?
* Characterizing them
* Can any of them be used as possible biocontrol? 

## Steps
0. [Sequencing](virus00sequencing.md) and file setup
1. [Quality check](virus01qc.md) including fastqc, readcounts, what percentage rRNA? aphid?
2. Assembly, mapping and taxonomic assignment and other [bioinformatics](virus02assembly.md)
3. [Differential abundance](virus03abundance)
