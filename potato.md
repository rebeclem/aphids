# Potato aphid project

We will run orthofinder on aphids that have similar sequencing quality (ie long reads), and then do something to visualize the synteny.

First step: find the genomes we want to use listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTeKEWSZg9Z5VIzDOeepkhvPFj-RW5Ua3oGiUnMjQRo/edit#gid=611073991). It should be a fasta file of a proteome (amino acid or peptide sequences) and preferably LTPG (longest transcript per gene). They need to be unzipped.
