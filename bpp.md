# Using BPP

BPP is a program to analyze sequence data with and without introgresion. It can estimate population size and species divergence times as well as species tree estimation and cross-species introgression intensity.

We will follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/bpp/bpp-tutorial/wiki)

1) First we need to make an Imap file-- two columns with one column of sample names and the second column of species names.
2) Next, we need to get a sequence file with alignments one after the other.
3) Finally we need a control file that points to the imap and sequence files.
4) To run, first you need to copy the program from github. Then use `export PATH=$PATH:~/mybpp`
5)
